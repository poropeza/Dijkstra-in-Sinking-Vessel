Characterization of a passenger vessel Sinking and finally  foundering at lacustrine environment

This paper considers a simulating crowds into a passenger vessel Evacuation in the face
of fire and the Effect of Human Behavior and Building Characteristics on Evacuation,
the most crucial aspect of a passenger`s vessel safety in the face of fire is the possibility
of safe escape. The study of attitudes and behavior of passengers in relation to reactions
to alarms, regulations, emergency signals, smoke and fire. An important precondition is
that its fire safety facilities enable independent and adequate fire response performances
by the passenger`s vessel. In practice, it appears that the measures currently required by
law do not always provide the support that people in burning cruiser's need and because
of lack of signs. In such circumstances, timely and effective evacuation of all passengers
and crew will be extremely important, and failure to evacuate in time may lead to
catastrophic consequences. Consequently, understanding how individuals behave in the
case of fire and fire evacuation is essential if we are to bring fire safety measures into
line with occupants’ needs during an incident. This paper contains a review of the
available literature on human behavior in a fire so far as ship safety is concerned. The
findings are presented as an overview of the critical factors which determine occupants’
fire response performances, namely the characteristics of fire, human beings and ship.
